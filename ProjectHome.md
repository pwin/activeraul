We propose a model and system for developing form-based Semantic Web applications. The ActiveRaUL RESTful Web service enables developers to deploy and manage Web forms and the data model associated with these forms. A key feature is the rendering of Web forms with the binding to an RDF graph maintained via RDFa. The ActiveRaUL framework follows an MVC pattern, which, combined with the proposed JavaScript RDFa API on the client, enables a seamless data binding of the input in a Web form to the data model via RDFa. By the virtue of typing Web form elements via RDF ontologies, existing Linked Data can be fetched at run-time from any Web resource to pre-populate a Web form.
